          <h4>Partner Project - New App Launch
          </h4>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="overview">
          <p>A core part of the experience at <a class="p-link" href="https://www.startupinstitute.com/boston/">Boston Startup Institute</a> is the partner project. Students from each track are teamed up with a local startup. Students get exposed to a startup's culture while putting in work that will, ideally, help out the startup in a meaningful way. Our partner company was <a class="p-link" href="http://www.ovuline.com/"> Ovuline</a>, an awesome company that is using data analytics to help people get pregnant and have healthy pregnancies. 
          </p>

          <p>Ovia was soon releasing a 3rd app to help parents in the first year of raising their newborn. They tasked us with gathering some insights to help them think about the launch of the new Parenting app.Our team consisted of two students from the technical marketing track, <a class="p-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacquelynleahy">Jacki</a> and <a class="p-link" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/iamsaia">Spectra</a> and two students from the design track, <a class="p-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hilary-walker-5178b529">Hilary</a> and <a class="p-link" href="http://thisjustin.businessradiox.com/2015/08/25/neurolaunch-demo-day/">me</a>. We met once week at Ovia's, over 6 weeks, to work on the project.

      <div class="row">
        <h3>Gathering</h3>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="overview">
          <p>We needed to get a feel for Ovia's existing branding, messaging, features, and users, Fortunately, they have two existing apps, <a class="p-link" href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id570244389">Fertility</a> and <a class="p-link" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ovia-pregnancy-tracker-baby/id719135369?mt=8">Pregnancy</a> that offered plenty of information. One of the best sources of information were the MyQ questions that provided statistics of how the other app users answered. I started answering them thinking there would be 10 or so. 500+ questions later I had a lot of screenshots. And data.

      <div class-"row-margin"></div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="overview margin-top">
          <p>We didn't have access to polling Ovia's existing users. We were just students, after all. Instead we did some research into developmental milestones and <a class="p-link" href="http://www.parenting.com/article/new-parents-8-most-asked-questions">popular parental questions</a> to inform the survey we would send out to our own netowrks.

      <div class="row">
        <h3>Ideate</h3>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="overview">
          <p>While we prepared to send the survey out the door, Hilary and I started brainstorming how we would incorporate Ovia's existing style into the launch of their new app. Note: this exercise was purely for our team, as Ovia had already created their soon to be released Parenting app. Hilary took the lead on creating a <a class="p-link" href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/boards/GW1GJIRQ4RFCU/"> mood board</a> and I created a style guide based on the mood board. The style guide would enable us to create different landing pages while maintaining a consistent look and feel.

      </div>



      <div class="row">
        <h3>Test</h3>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="overview">
          <p>We did some informal user testing to get feedback on the colors we were selecting for the Parenting app. Unlike to Ovia's two current apps, which focused on a woman's reproductive health and pregnancy, the Parenting app will be used with partners and shared with family and friends. Our goal was to select more neutral tones while mainting the Ovia brand.  
          </p>
          <p>We also tested our assumptions about what parents care about by digging into the results of <a class="p-link" href="http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/2680337/Parenting-2-0">our survey.</a> 
          <div class="ovia-survey">

      <div class="row">
        <h3>Build</h3>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="overview">
          <p>At this point, we felt we had enough data and feedback to mockup some landing pages. Plus, our deadline was rapidly approaching, so we didn't really have a choice. Hilary and I decided to use the good old <a class="p-link" href="https://blog.intercom.io/using-job-stories-design-features-ui-ux/">user stories framework</a>to create our landing pages. We came up with 4 different users to target for the Parenting app: a newsletter follower, an existing Ovia user, an in app follower, and a new Ovia user.

      <div class="row">
        <h3>Measure</h3>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="overview">
          <p>The real measurement for this project was our final presentation. Spectra presented the findings of our survey, Jacki presented social media insights and Hilary and I <a class="p-link" href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/Q96ZRIMPV#/screens">presented our designs</a>. I was responsible for the landing pages for the in app follower and the new app user.  
          </p>
          <p>Based on the thunderous applause, high fives, and champagne, I would say our presentation was a smashing success. While nothing in that last sentence actually happened, we did manage to make our partner company happy with our work.

          <p>What would have I done differently? A lot. Not much. Something in between.  
          </p>
          <p>Overall, it was a great experience. We used plenty of qualitative and quantitative data from a variety of resources to inform our decisions every step of the way. If there is one thing I would change, it would be getting more data on our designs. While I can blame time and <a class="p-link" href="https://www.usertesting.com/plans">budget</a> for not having done this, it would have provided an additional source of feedback on our designs.
